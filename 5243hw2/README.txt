%% Roee Ebenstein & Arathi Mani

This is homework 2.
it depends on hw1, therefore both are zipped together.
Though - we submitted the xmls of hw1 within the library, so you do not need to execute this project.
for instruction for HW1:
cd 5243hw2Py/hw1 
vi README.txt

to run this project - make sure you are in the current library
(if not "cd 5243hw2")
and execute:
java -Xmx3g -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -classpath bin:jars/lucene-analyzers-common-4.4.0.jar:jars/lucene-core-4.4.0.jar:jars/lucene-suggest-4.4.0.jar:jars/weka.jar AppLoader

As asked in class - we did not attach the output files for the classifications (there are now being created by the java app).

-- These instructions were tested on stdlinux.
